/*There are n people standing in a circle ready to be executed. The counting out starts at
some point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction. In every step, a
certain number of people are skipped and the next individual is executed. The removal
proceeds around the circle until last person remains, who is given freedom. Given the total
number of person N and a number k which indicates that k-1 persons are skipped and the kth
person is removed in a circle. The task is to choose the place in the initial circle so that you are
the last one remaining and so survive.*/
