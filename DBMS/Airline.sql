-- Consider the schema for Airline Database: 
-- Flights (Flight_num, Source, Destination, Distance, Departs, Arrives, Price) 
-- Aircraft (Aid, Aname, Cruising_range) 
-- Certified (Emp_id, Aid) 
-- Employees (Emp_id, Ename, Salary) 
-- Note: The Employees relation describes pilots and other kinds of employees as well; Every pilot is certified for some aircraft, and only pilots are certified to fly. 


-- Write SQL queries to 
-- 1.   Find the names of aircraft such that all pilots certified to operate them have salaries more than Rs.80, 000. 
-- 2. For each pilot who is certified for more than three aircrafts, find the emp_id and the maximum cruisingrange of the aircraft for which she or he is certified. 
-- 3. Find the names of pilots whose salary is less than the price of the cheapest route from Bengaluru to Mumbai. 
-- 4.   Find the aids of all aircraft that can be used on routes from Bengaluru to New Delhi. 
-- 5.   Find the employee name and salary earning second highest salary.
