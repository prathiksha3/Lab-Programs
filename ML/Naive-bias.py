/*There is a Vehicle class that encapsulates information about vehicles, including the vehicle 
number, their fuel capacity, and their fuel consumption rate. Use the Vehicle class as a starting point
from which more specialized classes are developed. For example, one type of vehicle is a Truck to 
carry its cargo capacity. Thus, to create a Truck class extend the Vehicle class, adding an instance 
variable that stores the goods carrying capacity. One more type of vehicle is Bus to carry people 
with a seating capacity. Create Bus class extends vehicle class, adding an instance of the seating 
capacity. Use the appropriate access specifier for data members and the methods are provided to 
read and display their values.*/
